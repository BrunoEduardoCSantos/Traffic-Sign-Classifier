# Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program #

## Overview  ##
In this project, a deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks was implemented to classify German traffic signs. The model was trained and validated using  [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, the model was tested to to identify images of German traffic signs around the web.

The base code is contained in the following IPython notebook: [Traffic_Sign_Classifier](https://github.com/BrunoEduardoCSantos/Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb).

A detailed description of the project is on writeup file: [writeup_template]. 


## Setup ##

1. Download the data set from:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BrunoEduardoCSantos/Traffic-Sign-Classifier
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
```
